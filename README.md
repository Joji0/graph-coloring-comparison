# Graph Coloring Comparison

This repository contains C++ implementations and benchmarking tools for analyzing the performance of three classic graph coloring algorithms:

- **Backtracking**
- **Basic Greedy**
- **DSatur (Degree of Saturation)**

The experiments were conducted as part of an academic study comparing these algorithms across a variety of synthetic graph instances, including:

- ErdÅ‘sâ€“RÃ©nyi (Random) Graphs
- Grid Graphs
- Bipartite Graphs
- Complete Graphs
- Crown Graphs

## ðŸ”§ Environment

All programs were written in **C++20** and compiled using the **GNU Compiler Collection (g++)** with optimization flag `-O2`. Benchmarks were conducted on a **MacBook Pro (Apple Silicon M4, 16GB RAM)**.
